# OCR_TamilCharacters
Our work aims to design an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system which can identify handwritten Tamil characters. Typically, OCR involves four different stages, namely - Pre-processing, feature extraction, Character Recognition and Post-processing. In this work, the block-wise Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) was used for feature extraction. Classification was done using two different techniques namely, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Network. Also, a performance analysis for the above classifiers is done. The classification was conducted for thirty-four Tamil alphabets
